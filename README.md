# resume
Benjamin RICHARD resumes. They are extracted / generated from linkedin with my MeteorJS application.

## Summary
This repo is a sample of what i can generate from a linkedin profile. I provide a software (SAAS) that 
allows you to grab information from linkedin and save it to your own database. From that information, you
can manage your relation with the candidate, and also with your collaborators.
